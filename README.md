# Mandelbrot Set
The Mandelbrot set is a region in the complex plane composed of all points C for which an iterative sequence Zn remains limited as long as n increases. This sequence is generated by the equation \[ z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c \]
where Zn is a complex number that represents the current iteration and C is a point in the complex plane being tested.
